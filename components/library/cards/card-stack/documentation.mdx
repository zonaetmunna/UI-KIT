# Card Stack

A stacked card component with auto-flipping animation that creates a dynamic visual hierarchy of content.

## Features

- Auto-rotating cards that swap positions at regular intervals
- Smooth animations powered by Framer Motion
- Configurable offset and scale factor for card stacking
- Responsive design that works on all screen sizes

## Installation

Make sure you have `framer-motion` installed in your project:

```bash
npm install framer-motion
# or
yarn add framer-motion
```

## Usage

```tsx
import { CardStack } from "@/components/library/cards/card-stack";

export function MyComponent() {
  const items = [
    {
      id: 1,
      name: "John Doe",
      designation: "Software Engineer",
      content: <p>"This is a wonderful component!"</p>,
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      name: "Jane Smith",
      designation: "UX Designer",
      content: <p>"I love using this in my projects."</p>,
    },
    // Add more items as needed
  ];

  return (
    <CardStack
      items={items}
      offset={10} // Optional: Controls the vertical spacing between cards
      scaleFactor={0.06} // Optional: Controls how much each card scales down
    />
  );
}
```
